For both of the exercise you can find a starting project in the "Starting_Code" folder.

# Exercise 1

In the folder Exercise 01, you will find the code that was discussed in class to show the different steps to refactor your code to conform to OCP.

Using the Refact 02 project as a base, add a triangle as an extra shape without breaking OCP.

# Exercise 2

In the folder Exercise 02, you will find a project where you have a person class and a student class.

This program breaks OCP at several points.

Your task is to refactor the code so the student class can be added without breaking OCP on the main Person class.
