# Exercises

Use Visual Studio to create the following form using XAML and C#.  
The idea is for you to experiment with the languages and see what you can create.  

There are some key things to do when you are making this application.

* The idea is to sepearate the UI from the Business logic as much as possible.

An example of the form is here:
