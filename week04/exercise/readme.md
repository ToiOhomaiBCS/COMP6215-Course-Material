# Exercises

Over the last couple of weeks you have made a number of GUI applications.
Now with your new knowledge of styling, make them look nice.

# Bonus Points

Can you add responsive code to your application? 

To extend yourself, allow for some changes based on the size of your application.  
You may be able to change the background colour or manipulate the grid in some way.

Be creative :-)

You are allowed to code these changes, since some of these are triggered by a dynamic response.

# TIP

In your assignment, there are marks for nice looking applications - make use of your styling skills.
